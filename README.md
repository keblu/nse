`nse` ([Ardia and Bluteau, 2017](http://dx.doi.org/10.21105/joss.00172)) is an R package for computing the numerical standard error (NSE), an estimate 
of the standard deviation of a simulation result, if the simulation experiment were to be repeated 
many times. The package provides a set of wrappers around several R packages, which give access to 
more than thirty NSE estimators, including batch means estimators, initial sequence 
estimators, spectrum at zero estimators, heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation 
consistent (HAC) kernel estimators and bootstrap estimators. See [Ardia and Bluteau (2017)](http://dx.doi.org/10.21105/joss.00172) for details. The full set of methods available in `nse` is summarized in [Ardia et al. (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1515/jtse-2017-0011) together with several examples of applications in econometrics and finance.

The latest stable version of `nse` is available at [https://cran.r-project.org/package=nse](https://cran.r-project.org/package=nse).

The latest development version of `nse` is available at [https://github.com/keblu/nse)](https://github.com/keblu/nse).
